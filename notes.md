Which deliverable scope and target use case should I produce first for the DCH design?

Full technical specification for researchers: formal definitions, algorithmic details for DHG construction with TC-kNN, hyperedge plasticity rules, constrained backward hyperpath traversal with B-walk adaptation, streaming frequent hyperpath mining, and meta-controller policy; include complexity analysis, concrete data structures, clear interfaces, and 3-4 Mermaid diagrams; plus a 4-6 page hardware co-design overview for Causa-Chip. Target use case: event vision (DVS Gesture, N-MNIST) with a Python prototype plan using PyTorch Norse; 20-30 pages total.

Software-first prototype plan: end-to-end implementable blueprint in Python using Norse or BindsNET with data model, pipeline stages, module responsibilities, pseudocode-level algorithms, and test harness; evaluation protocol on DVS Gesture and N-MNIST; defer hardware to a brief mapping note. Deliverable: 10-15 pages plus a prioritized backlog for rapid prototyping.

Hardware-first architecture brief: deep dive on Causa-Chip microarchitecture including GMF memory fabric with ReRAM PIM, PTA PE array topology and scheduling, FSM pipeline stages with canonical labeling and counting units, NoC bandwidth plan, and area-power-latency estimates at 7 nm; only a concise algorithm summary. Deliverable: 12-18 pages with block and dataflow diagrams.

Executive whitepaper section: concept-first narrative with formalism and diagrams, minimal pseudocode, emphasis on interpretability, continual learning, and neuro-symbolic integration; include 2 Mermaid diagrams and a short hardware roadmap. Deliverable: 8-12 pages optimized for leadership and funding review.
