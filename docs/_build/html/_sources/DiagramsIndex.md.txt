# Dynamic Causal Hypergraph DCH â€” Diagrams Index and Render Guide

Purpose  
This index catalogs all Mermaid diagrams across the DCH spec to support consistency checks and PDF export. Each entry links to the source section. Use the Render Guide below to validate diagrams.

Render Guide
- VS Code preview Install the Mermaid Markdown extension; open each linked file and ensure diagrams render.  
- CLI export Option A mermaid-cli
  - npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
  - mmdc -i input.md -o output.pdf with a markdown-to-pdf pipeline that preserves Mermaid.  
- CLI export Option B Pandoc with Mermaid filter
  - pandoc --from gfm --to pdf --filter pandoc-mermaid -o docs/export/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.pdf docs/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.md
- Verify anchors After export, click internal links in the PDF to confirm they resolve.

Checklist for reviewers
- Diagrams render without syntax errors in all listed files.  
- Terminology nodes and labels match the text e.g., DHG, PTA, FSM, HOE, WL, SAGE.  
- Arrows reflect correct data and control flow according to the section narratives.  
- Duplicate diagrams quick views in the Outline are consistent with the authoritative versions in Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15.

Known formatting caveats
- Avoid double quotes and parentheses inside Mermaid node labels to prevent parse errors; the spec conforms to this requirement.  
- Long labels may wrap differently across renderers ensure readability in both VS Code preview and CLI export.
