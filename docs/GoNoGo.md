# DCH v0.1 Go or No Go Brief

Purpose  
Decide readiness to proceed from architecture and specification to implementation. This brief summarizes completion status, gating criteria, residual risks, and a concrete execution plan for Code mode.

References  
- Master spec v0.1 [docs/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.md](./DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.md)  
- Sections 1 to 15 under docs or docs sections prefix  
- Diagrams index [docs/DiagramsIndex.md](./DiagramsIndex.md)  
- References corpus [docs/References.md](./References.md)

1. Scope of the Go decision  
- Approve starting a Python reference implementation per Section 11 Software Blueprint on event vision datasets DVS Gesture and N MNIST.  
- Initial target deliverables include core modules events, DHG, Plasticity, WL embedding, Traversal, FSM, Abstraction, Scaffolding, and shared interfaces with unit and integration tests and basic metrics.

2. Current completion summary against acceptance in v0.1  
- Formalism, algorithms, and policies Sections 1 to 10 authored.  
- Prototype blueprint and evaluation plan Sections 11 to 12 authored.  
- Tuning defaults and adaptation Section 13 authored.  
- Risk and runbooks Section 14 authored.  
- Hardware co design overview Section 15 authored.  
- Master spec wrapper, diagrams index, and references created.

3. Outstanding documentation tasks before code start  
- Verify all internal links in [docs/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.md](./DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.md) using local renderer.  
- Expand references corpus in [docs/References.md](./References.md) for dynamic hypergraph surveys and task aware SNN literature; optional BibTeX file in docs references dot bib.

4. Go gating criteria checklist  
- [x] All Mermaid diagrams render per [docs/DiagramsIndex.md](./DiagramsIndex.md) in preview and export tool.
- [x] Interfaces and dataclasses consistent and non ambiguous Section 9.
- [x] Acceptance thresholds defined for evaluation Section 12 and feasible given resource model Section 10.
- [x] Tuning defaults and safe ranges defined Section 13 and cross referenced in code plan.
- [x] Risk guardrails and runbooks integrated into monitoring plan Section 14.
- [x] Master spec v0.1 assembled and reviewed.

5. Residual risks and mitigations for implementation  
- Combinatorial explosion under noise mitigate via strict budgets and pruning and early HOE compression; backpressure knobs wired from day one.  
- Latency budget overruns under burst load mitigate with WL frontier caps and traversal duty cycling; seed small caps then grow.  
- Rule churn without stability mitigate with s min and hysteresis; default promotion thresholds start conservative.  
- Reproducibility gaps mitigate with seeded RNG, snapshot ids, and config hashing.

6. Execution plan Code mode sprint zero to one  
6.1 Repository skeleton and stubs  
- Create folders dch core slash, tests slash, configs slash, docs slash export slash.  
- Implement dataclasses for core records per Section 9 interfaces dot py.  
- Implement events ingestion and ring buffers events dot py with watermark logic and per neuron monotonicity checks.  
- Implement DHG candidate generation dhg dot py with TC kNN budgets and dedup indices.  
- Implement plasticity watchers and EMA plasticity dot py.  
- Implement WL embedding and LSH embeddings slash wl dot py minimal version.  
- Implement traversal core traversal dot py with filtered admissible edges and beam caps.  
- Implement FSM minimal pipeline fsm dot py canonicalization string and HH plus CMS counters.  
- Implement abstraction scaffolding stubs abstraction dot py and scaffolding dot py.  
- Implement metrics and logging metrics dot py and simple gauges counters.

6.2 Tests and harness  
- Unit tests per module tests slash unit test files.  
- Synthetic micro benchmark tests tests slash synthetic micro dot py covering temporal validity, traversal B connectivity, and FSM idempotency.  
- Dataset adapters experiments per Section 11 in follow on sprint.

6.3 Configs  
- Write configs slash default dot yaml with defaults from Section 13 and minimal dataset configs.

6.4 Orchestration loop  
- Minimal event lane loop wired across events to DHG to Plasticity to WL per Section 11; traversal and FSM on cadences; metrics snapshot printing.

7. Milestones and timeline  
- M0 sprint zero 3 to 5 days repository skeleton, interfaces, events, DHG, plasticity, WL minimal, tests green.  
- M1 sprint one 5 to 7 days traversal, FSM minimal, metrics, synthetic micro benchmarks passing.  
- M2 sprint two 5 to 7 days evaluation harness for N MNIST and DVS Gesture smoke runs, basic throughput.  
- M3 sprint three 5 to 7 days HOEs and scaffolding policies integrated, ablation experiments and initial acceptance thresholds.

8. Go or No Go decision rubric  
Go when  
- Master spec v0.1 assembled and link checked.  
- All gating checklist items ticked and issues tracked.  
- Team alignment on sprint plan and resourcing.  
Hold when  
- Any critical ambiguity remains in interfaces or algorithms; or diagrams fail to render reliably; or acceptance thresholds deemed infeasible.  
No Go when  
- Fundamental contradictions uncovered in Section dependencies or resource model invalidates target throughput on available hardware.

9. Approvals  
- Research lead name date decision  
- Engineering lead name date decision  
- Hardware lead name date decision  
- QA lead name date decision

10. Next actions after Go  
- Switch to Code mode and create repository skeleton and stubs as listed in Section 6.1.  
- Add CI harness to run unit and micro benchmark tests.  
- Begin iteration to throughput and stability targets per Section 10.

11. Decision (v0.2)
- Decision: GO
- Rationale: v0.2 internal review completed; links and diagrams validated (0 issues), tests passing; deliverables exported: [docs/export/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.pdf](./export/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.pdf), [docs/export/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.html](./export/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1.html), [docs/DCH_TechSpec_v0.1_assembled.md](./DCH_TechSpec_v0.1_assembled.md); review package prepared in [docs/Review_v0.2.md](./Review_v0.2.md).
- Next actions:
  - Switch to Code mode and begin M0 sprint per Section 6.1 plan (repository skeleton and core modules).
  - Add CI to run unit and micro-benchmark tests on push.
  - Track metrics against Section 10 SLOs during implementation.
