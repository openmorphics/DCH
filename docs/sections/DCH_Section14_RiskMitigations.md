Version v0.1

1. Objectives  
- Identify principal algorithmic, systems, and governance risks for DCH.  
- Define concrete mitigations, monitors, and automated responses.  
- Provide stress tests and runbooks to recover service and ensure scientific validity.

2. Risk inventory and drivers  
2.1 Combinatorial explosion (edges and paths)  
- Drivers: high in-degree Pred j, wide Δ windows, high k_max, low pruning thresholds, sparse supervision.  
- Symptoms: queue lag, memory growth, traversal valid ratio collapse, rule churn spikes.

2.2 Spurious causality and noise coupling  
- Drivers: temporal coincidence within Δ windows, WL hash/LSH collisions, low s_min in FSM, unreliable labels.  
- Symptoms: low watcher confirm rate, unstable r_e oscillations, short-lived rules.

2.3 Nonstationarity and drift  
- Drivers: sensor dynamics, scene changes, task switches.  
- Symptoms: rising miss rates, rule demotions, HOE reliability decay.

2.4 Catastrophic forgetting and interference  
- Drivers: learning new tasks reusing old subgraphs without protection.  
- Symptoms: r_e depression on prior-task edges, accuracy drop on old tasks.

2.5 Latency and throughput violations  
- Drivers: bursty λ, oversized WL frontier, deep traversal, FSM churn.  
- Symptoms: missed real-time budgets, backlogs, timeouts.

2.6 Memory pressure and fragmentation  
- Drivers: |E(t)| growth, large HOE registry, oversized embedding tables.  
- Symptoms: allocator pressure, OOM risk, swap thrash.

2.7 Determinism and reproducibility gaps  
- Drivers: unseeded RNGs, nondeterministic hashing, unsynchronized snapshots.  
- Symptoms: irreproducible runs, audit mismatch.

2.8 Interpretability failure (rules that mis-explain)  
- Drivers: overfit templates, path double counting, weak audit thresholds.  
- Symptoms: high accuracy but low audit success or inconsistent explanations.

2.9 Security and privacy exposure  
- Drivers: exporting raw timestamps and neuron ids, verbose provenance.  
- Symptoms: re-identification risks, policy noncompliance.

2.10 Hardware co-design feasibility  
- Drivers: PIM atomic update fidelity, NoC contention, FSM canonicalization throughput, PE partitioning.  
- Symptoms: stalls, hot spots, underutilization, energy regressions.

2.11 Evaluation validity and metric gaming  
- Drivers: label misalignment, cherry-picked cadences, incomplete baselines.  
- Symptoms: inflated metrics without robustness, poor external replication.

3. Mitigations and controls  
3.1 Combinatorics control  
- Tight windows Δ (Section 13 presets), δ_causal coherence, DHG budgets M_in and C_cap, k_max ≤ 3.  
- Reliability-based pruning (Section 3) with τ_prune, freshness-weighted eviction; HOE compression (Section 7).  
- Meta-controller backpressure (Section 10) to lower C_cap and raise τ_prune when queue lag crosses L_q_high.

3.2 Anti-spurious causality  
- Enforce temporal logic strictly (Section 5), refractory ρ (Section 1), and B-connectivity.  
- WL cosine threshold τ_cos, LSH collision threshold τ_LSH; deduplication by canonical tail signature (Section 2).  
- FSM thresholds s_min, r_min, hysteresis D_stab (Section 6); s_path_min to filter low-confidence paths.

3.3 Drift handling  
- FSM dual-window drift detectors; adapt γ and s_min; re-learn Δ envelopes via quantile tracking (Section 13 auto calibration).  
- Increase λ_path temporarily to favor supervised paths during drift.

3.4 Forgetting protection  
- Scaffolding FREEZE with TTL and review (Section 8); regionization with ε_leak guard; rule and HOE protection lists.  
- Hybrid mode for partial reuse; audit depression events on frozen edges with τ_conflict alarms.

3.5 Latency assurance  
- WL frontier cap F_max; traversal caps L, B, C_in; duty-cycling T_trav; FSM tick budgets.  
- Sharded DHG/WL lanes; priority queues; non-blocking design (Section 11 threading).  
- Auto-throttle: raise Δt_WL, reduce K seeds under load.

3.6 Memory governance  
- Global caps for |E|, K_head, K_HOE_global; quantize WL to fp16; compress indices.  
- Aged pruning with s_prune = r_e·exp(−λ_age·age); HOE merge (Section 7).  
- Snapshot retention policy; evict stale SAGE snapshots.

3.7 Reproducibility  
- Seeded RNG with cycle- and vertex-derived seeds (Section 5).  
- Stable 64-bit hashes; deterministic canonicalization; idempotency keys (Section 9).  
- Snapshot ids for WL, SAGE, FSM; config hashing (Section 13).

3.8 Interpretability guarantees  
- Audit pipeline: enforce τ_audit for path scores; coverage metric; store top-k paths per decision.  
- Rule promotion precision proxy ≥ 70% active duration (Section 6); avoid double counting in HOE compression (Section 7).

3.9 Security and privacy  
- Hash neuron ids for export; quantize timestamps to q_time; role-based access for freeze and policy updates (Section 9).  
- Provenance redaction outside secure boundary; TTL on exemplars.

3.10 Hardware risk mitigations  
- Pre-silicon: cycle-accurate co-sim of GSE, GMF, PTA, FSM with recorded traces; Roofline and NoC contention models.  
- Fallback paths: software-only traversal and FSM when hardware stalls; graceful degradation policies.  
- PIM atomicity tests and endurance modeling; CAM/hash sizing for FSM counting.

3.11 Evaluation integrity  
- Ground-truth seed tolerance ±2 ms; macro-F1 reporting; five-seed statistics with CI; Holm–Bonferroni corrections.  
- Baseline parity on label exposure; ablations catalog (Section 12).

4. Guardrails and monitors (with targets)  
- Queue lag watermark: warn ≥ 10 ms, act ≥ 25 ms → reduce C_cap 20%, raise τ_prune 25%.  
- Watcher confirm rate: warn < 55%, act < 40% → shrink Δ windows 10%, raise τ_prune.  
- Traversal valid ratio: warn < 50% → increase w_rule and WL boost.  
- Rule churn per minute: warn > 2× baseline → raise s_min; raise γ.  
- Memory occupancy: warn ≥ 80% cap, act ≥ 90% → demote cold edges; shrink WL d to 48 or 32.  
- HOE path shortening: warn < 1.2× → adjust eligibility; merge/factor HOEs.

5. Stress-test plan  
- Synthetic micrographs: planted chains with varying Δ and noise; evaluate precision/recall and r_e stability.  
- Collision fuzzing: adversarial tail signatures and WL hash collisions; ensure deduplication and LSH thresholds.  
- Drift injection: piecewise delay distributions; monitor drift detectors and adaptation.  
- Burst load: 2–3× λ for 100 ms; validate backpressure and latency SLOs.  
- HOE spurious promotion: inject frequent but unreliable templates; verify hysteresis and demotion.

6. Failure runbooks  
- High queue lag: throttle DHG (C_cap↓), WL cadence↑, traversal cadence↑; snapshot; persist state; resume after drain.  
- Rule storm: raise s_min, γ; pause promotions; audit top templates.  
- Memory crisis: freeze HOE creation; increase τ_prune; evict stale snapshots; persist and compact indices.  
- Reproducibility alert: lock snapshots; dump seeds and config hash; rerun minimal replay for audit.

7. Acceptance criteria for Section 14  
- Risks categorized with symptoms and drivers.  
- Mitigations, monitors, and automated actions specified and mapped to earlier modules.  
- Stress tests and runbooks documented with concrete actions and thresholds.  
- Security and hardware feasibility considerations included.
