# Dynamic Causal Hypergraph (DCH) â€” Core package
# License: MIT

"""
Core package exposing typed interfaces and default engines for DCH.

Primary modules
- interfaces: typed data models and Protocols for hypergraph structures and engines
- hypergraph_mem: in-memory HypergraphOps and connectivity oracle (CPU-friendly)
- dhg: TC-kNN dynamic hypergraph construction (candidate generation + admission)
- traversal: constrained backward hyperpath traversal (beam with AND-frontier)
- plasticity: evidence-based reliability updates and pruning

This __init__ consolidates common exports for convenience:
    from dch_core import (
        Event, Vertex, Hyperedge, HypergraphSnapshot, Hyperpath, PlasticityState,
        HypergraphOps, GraphConnectivity, DHGConstructor, TraversalEngine, PlasticityEngine,
        InMemoryHypergraph, StaticGraphConnectivity,
        DefaultDHGConstructor, DefaultTraversalEngine, DefaultPlasticityEngine,
    )
